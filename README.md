Harry's Cloak Effect with OpenCV
This project recreates the "invisibility cloak" effect from Harry Potter using OpenCV in Python. The program captures the background, then uses HSV masking to hide a specific color (usually the color of a cloak or cloth), creating the illusion of invisibility.

Features
Allows dynamic adjustment of HSV range using trackbars for real-time fine-tuning.
Uses median blur and dilation to improve the mask quality and reduce noise.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Numpy
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/invisibility-cloak.git
cd invisibility-cloak
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code:

bash
Copy code
python invisibility_cloak.py
Usage
Initialize the Camera: The script will start the camera and display a window with trackbars for HSV values.

Adjust the Trackbars:

Use the upper_hue, upper_saturation, and upper_value trackbars to set the upper range of the HSV mask.
Use the lower_hue, lower_saturation, and lower_value trackbars to set the lower range of the HSV mask.
Adjust these values until the cloak or cloth you want to disappear is completely masked.
Press 'q' to Quit: Press the q key to close the application.

Code Explanation
Initialize Camera: The code begins by capturing frames from the default camera and sets up a window with trackbars to adjust HSV values.
Capture Initial Background Frame: The code captures a frame to use as the background, which will appear behind the masked area.
Define the HSV Range for Masking: Adjust HSV values to mask the cloak color accurately.
Apply Mask and Create Cloak Effect:
Apply masking to the live frame to remove the specified color.
Overlay the background on the masked area to create the "invisibility" effect.
Example
Running the program should display a live video feed with the selected color appearing transparent, making it look like you're wearing an invisibility cloak!
